--[[

diffAdded, difficulty added when this is spawned, prevents it from spawning 300 tanks at once, getting ahead of itself
diffNeeded, target difficulty neeeded, only spawn this when its supposed to be difficult, or easy
diffMax, dont spawn this when target difficulty is above this.
passChance, kinda unintitive, the code goes thru this table in a loop, so stuff at the bottom will override stuff at the top,
            basically this is the chance to NOT override what came before
batchSize, makes this into a batch spawn, so like 6 of one thing
randomSpawnAnyway,   randomly spawn this even if none of the conditions are met
maxAtOnce, max count of this on the field at once, checks class
